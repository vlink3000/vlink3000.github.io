        <p>It&#8217;s been a busy half year, not only for me and my team at <a href="http://fromtheoutfit.com">The Outfit</a>, but in the content management world as well. Recently I put <a href="http://statamic.com">Statamic</a> through its paces and, while it&#8217;s definitely worth a look, now it&#8217;s <a href="http://buildwithcraft.com">Craft&#8217;s</a> turn with it&#8217;s recently released 1.0 version.</p>

<h2 id="initial-impressions">Initial impressions</h2>

<p>I like Craft a lot. The <a href="http://pixelandtonic.com/">Pixel &amp; Tonic</a> team has taken the opportunity of a clean slate to make an unburdened and modern content management system. It comes with features out of the box that make it powerful enough for developers to love, but with a simple yet feature-packed control panel to make clients swoon. They probably won&#8217;t swoon, but they should. Here are my favorite bits:</p>

<h3 id="business-model">Business Model</h3>

<p>The base of Craft is free, which is plenty for you to get a sense of what the software can do. Need more features? Pay only for what you need. This freemium model was a wise move to boost developer adoption – it worked on me. Upgrades for multiple content sections, users and more are individual &#8220;packages&#8221; which can be activated from the Craft control panel.</p>

<h3 id="one-click-updating">One Click Updating</h3>

<p>I don&#8217;t understand why this feature is so hard to come by. When I heard that Craft had it, my heart fluttered. For me, giving a client (or myself) the ability to keep their CMS up-to-date is key. Up-to-date sites are more secure for the client and make it easier for developers to pick up old projects with confidence.</p>

<h3 id="live-preview">Live Preview</h3>

<p>There hasn&#8217;t been a project I&#8217;ve worked on where this question doesn&#8217;t pop up: &#8220;How do I preview my page before it goes live?&#8221; And it always breaks my heart to say: &#8220;Well it&#8217;s possible, but it&#8217;s going to take more time and money.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is one of those features that is typically underrated by developers and adored and/or expected by clients who are not as confident about web publishing. Craft&#8217;s implementation of Live Preview is incredibly elegant and beautifully executed.</p>

<h3 id="control-panel">Control Panel</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s customizable, responsive and beautifully designed. There&#8217;s very little to learn and it&#8217;s eminently approachable. I know that this is sounding a little gushy at this point but, hey, credit where credit is due.</p>

<h3 id="glorious-field-types">Glorious Field Types!</h3>

<p>Craft comes with a bundle of field types to help you make a great CMS experience for your client. Each field type is like a tool in your toolbox and they&#8217;re fairly intuitive to use.</p>

<h3 id="twig-for-templating">Twig for Templating</h3>

<p>Craft uses <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org">Twig</a> to handle templating which is by far the biggest learning curve I experienced while getting to know the CMS. I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface of Twig but the power is obvious. The slide out panel on this blog for example, which requires a custom plugin in Statamic or ExpressionEngine, is achievable in Twig with no extra plugins.</p>

<h2 id="early-days">Early days</h2>

<p>The only drawback that I can see at the moment is the lack of a robust library of plugins. <a href="http://straightupcraft.com/craft-plugins">Straight up Craft</a> is off to a decent start but it&#8217;s hardly comprehensive&#8230; for now.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>

<p>While the docs are well organized and definitely helpful, I found <a href="http://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/craft-cms-tutorial/">Mijingo&#8217;s tutorial videos</a> very helpful to get started. We&#8217;re spoiled rotten with good CMS choices these days but Craft is definitely worth a shot.</p>
