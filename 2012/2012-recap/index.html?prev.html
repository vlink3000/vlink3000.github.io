        <p>A lot changed in 2012. Here are some notable highlights, roughly in order of how they happened:</p>

<h2 id="good-looks">Good Looks</h2>

<p>In January, Amy, my partner in both domestic and business capacities, decided she was ready to start writing about style and fashion, subjects which she has developed quite a passion for. So, like good web workers, she designed and I built <a href="http://goodlooksdaily.com">Good Looks Daily</a> for her. In April, Amy got over her fear of having her photo taken and recruited me to be her photographer. I think we&#8217;ve amassed a nice <a href="http://goodlooksdaily.com/outfits">body of work</a> over the year. It&#8217;s been inspiring to watch Amy find her voice and grow a following of other fashion focused people around the world.</p>

<p>In May I helped release <a href="http://goodlooksapp.com">Good Looks for iPhone</a> with <a href="http://goodlooksdaily.com">Amy</a>, who did a beautiful job of design, and <a href="http://twitter.com/whitedonkey">Geoff Bradford</a>, who did an outstanding job on the iOS development. I worked on the user experience and the feature set of the app, something I&#8217;d like to do more of in the future.</p>

<h2 id="goodbye-height--hands-hello-the-outfit">Goodbye Height &amp; Hands, Hello The Outfit</h2>

<p>After a little more than a year of Height &amp; Hands, we formed <a href="http://fromtheoutfit.com">The Outfit</a> in June. The <a href="http://perrera.com/blog/introducing_the_outfit">announcement</a> had to wait until July because we were knee deep in setting up our business, getting settled in our new Boston office, and working on our first project for <a href="http://trunk.evernote.com">Evernote</a>.</p>

<p>Being a partner at The Outfit has been the most exhilarating professional endeavor that I&#8217;ve ever participated in. There are not enough nice words to say about my partners <a href="http://twitter.com/amyhparker">Amy</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/drj">Johannes</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/marcamos">Marc</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/michaelwitwicki">Michael</a>. With them, work is an absolute joy and the possibilities of what we can do as a company seem endless.</p>

<p>If the last six months are any indication, we have a bright future ahead. In fact, we already have some exciting news queued up for early 2013.</p>

<h2 id="health-and-fitness">Health and Fitness</h2>

<p>In August I started a weight loss competition with some friends. Since I was about to turn 30, the time was right for me to reassess my poor dietary habits and underwhelming workout routine. With the help of <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com">MyFitnessPal</a> on iOS, I kept a log of my calories and tracked my weight.</p>

<p>Logging my calories was truly enlightening. Now I have a great sense of how much food is enough, what foods satisfy me, and what choices I need to make to maintain a more healthy weight. My biggest surprise was how few compromises I had to make.</p>

<p>I started out at a hefty 219 lbs and have since come down over 25 lbs to 193. Thanks to these changes, my energy level is up, I&#8217;m more focused and efficient when I sit down to work, and my baseline mood has improved.</p>

<h2 id="travel-and-a-big-birthday">Travel and a Big Birthday</h2>

<p>In September I turned 30 and to celebrate, Amy and I went on a week long cruise of Northern Europe followed by another week in London. We ate a lot of good food, drank a lot of good beer, and reconnected with one of my good friends who lives there.</p>

<p>It was amazing, as always, to see other countries and broaden my world view. On this trip in particular, I gained a new found respect for mobile bandwidth thanks to an old iPhone 3GS and a pre-paid Vodafone sim card. I&#8217;ve since been highly aware of building mobile experiences that are efficient and fast.</p>

<h2 id="for-2013">For 2013</h2>

<p>Personally, I still need to work on having a hobby. I&#8217;ve decided to pick  up the guitar again after many years away. Professionally, I&#8217;ve already begun to hone my JavaScript skills and plan on taking them to the next level in the coming year. And <a href="http://perrera.com/blog/2011_recap">once again</a>, I&#8217;ll remind myself to be open to change and be objective in my decisions, seeing as that worked out pretty well last year.</p>
